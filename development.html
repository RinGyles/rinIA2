            <!-- Summary and Reflection -->
            <p>I've been reading chapters 4 to 7 of "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener. These chapters have provided valuable insights 
                into personal development and growth. Here's a summary and reflection:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 4 - The Gift of Learning:</strong> This chapter emphasizes the importance of lifelong learning. 
                It highlights that personal development is an ongoing journey, and the more we learn, the more we grow. 
                I resonate with this message as I believe in the power of continuous self-improvement. To apply this to my life,
                 I will make a commitment to dedicate time each day to learning something new, whether it's through books, courses, or real-life experiences.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 5 - The Gift of Change:</strong> Change is an inevitable part of life, and this chapter discusses the necessity of embracing it 
                rather than fearing it. It teaches that change can lead to growth and improvement if we approach it with a positive mindset. I'll apply this by 
                being more open to change in my life, whether it's in my personal relationships or my academic pursuits. I'll see change as an opportunity for personal development.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 6 - The Gift of Problems:</strong> Problems are a part of everyone's life, but how we handle them determines our success. This chapter teaches that 
                problems are opportunities for growth and that successful people view them as challenges to overcome. I'll apply this by adopting a problem-solving mindset, 
                focusing on solutions rather than dwelling on the issues themselves.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 7 - The Gift of Family:</strong>Family plays a crucial role in our lives, and this chapter highlights the significance of maintaining strong family 
                connections. It discusses the importance of investing time and effort in our relationships with family members. I'll apply this by prioritizing quality time with 
                my family and nurturing those relationships, knowing that a strong family foundation can provide invaluable support in my personal and academic life.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Degree and Skills</h2>

                <p><strong>Degree:</strong> I am working towards a Bachelor of sports science.</p>

                <p><strong>Top Three Skills Acquired:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Knowledge of Human Anatomy and Physiology:</b> Sports Science programs provide a deep understanding of the human body, including its muscular, skeletal, 
                        cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Students learn how these systems function during exercise, which is essential for designing effective training 
                        programs and preventing injuries.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>Sports Performance Analysis:</b> Students acquire skills in analyzing sports performance, including techniques for assessing athletes' strengths and 
                        weaknesses. This skill involves using tools and technology to evaluate factors such as biomechanics, nutrition, and training methods to enhance athletic performance.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>xercise Prescription and Training:</b> Sports Science programs teach students how to create tailored exercise programs for individuals and athletes. 
                        This skill includes designing fitness routines, considering injury prevention, and understanding the principles of periodization to optimize training over time.</li>
